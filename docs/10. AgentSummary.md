## Key Features Across All Agents

### MCP Tool Usage
All agents utilize:
- Sequential Thinking for complex problem-solving
- Web Search for research and best practices
- Tavily for deep technical research
- Context7 for framework documentation
- Knowledge Graph for continuity
- Filesystem for document management

### Common Standards
- All deliverables in Markdown format
- CamelCase file naming convention
- Files saved to `/Users/tony/claude project management/docs/[project-name]/`
- Each agent reads all previous documents
- Clear handoff instructions to next agent

### Document References
Each agent must:
1. Read all previous phase documents
2. Reference specific sections when making decisions
3. Ensure alignment with overall project goals
4. Create deliverables that serve subsequent phases

## Usage Instructions
1. Start with the Project Manager prompt for discovery
2. Progress sequentially through each agent
3. Ensure each agent has access to all previous documents
4. Review deliverables before proceeding to next phase
5. Use the handoff instructions for smooth transitions
