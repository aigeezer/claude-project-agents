# ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

**Note: This guide is for Claude Desktop App users. The MCP tools will not work in the web-based version of Claude.**

Welcome to the Claude Project Management Agent Pipeline! This guide will get you up and running in minutes.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aigeezer/claude-project-agents.git
cd claude-project-agents
```

## Step 2: Setup MCP Tools (Optional but Recommended)

1. Copy `claude_desktop_config.json` to your Claude Desktop configuration directory:
   - **macOS**: `/Users/[yourname]/Library/Application Support/Claude/`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\`
   - **Linux**: `~/.config/claude/`
2. Restart Claude Desktop to load the MCPs
3. The agents will use these tools for enhanced functionality

## Step 3: Run Environment Setup

```bash
cd scripts
chmod +x make_executable.sh
./make_executable.sh
cd ..
./scripts/setup_environment.sh
```

When prompted, enter your preferred base directory path (e.g., `/Users/yourname`).

## Step 4: Start Your First Project

1. Open Claude Desktop App (not the web version)
2. Copy the content from `docs/1. ProjectManagerPrompt.md`
3. Paste it into Claude
4. Tell Claude about your project idea
5. Follow the agent's instructions

## Step 5: Continue Through the Pipeline

Each agent will:
- Create documentation in your project folder
- Prepare deliverables for the next agent
- Update the build plan

Progress through all 9 agents:
1. Project Manager
2. UI/UX Designer
3. Technical Architect
4. Frontend Developer
5. Backend Developer
6. DevOps Engineer
7. QA Engineer
8. Site Reliability Engineer
9. Product Analyst

## That's it! ðŸŽ‰

Your project will have comprehensive documentation and a clear development path from concept to production.
