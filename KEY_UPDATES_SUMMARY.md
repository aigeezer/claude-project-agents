# üîç Key Updates Summary

This document summarizes the critical updates made to ensure actual code implementation rather than just documentation.

## Critical Changes Made

### 1. Code Writing Clarification
- **Original Issue**: Frontend and Backend prompts created documentation instead of code
- **Solution**: Created v2 prompts that explicitly write actual code to filesystem
- **Key Change**: Use `write_file` tool directly, NOT artifacts

### 2. Filesystem vs Artifacts
- **Artifacts**: Display code in Claude's window (not desired)
- **Filesystem**: Write code directly to project files (desired approach)
- **Updated Instructions**: All code must be written using `write_file` tool

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration
Both Frontend and Backend Developers now:
- Create entities for progress tracking
- Update knowledge graph after each component
- Store technical decisions and checkpoints
- Track API endpoints and completions

### 4. Session Continuity System
Created comprehensive system for handling chat limits:
- SESSION_STATE.md - Current progress
- IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md - Work history  
- HANDOFF.md - Session transition details
- Knowledge graph checkpoints

### 5. Frontend-Backend Contract
Clear handoff process:
1. Frontend defines APIContracts.md
2. Backend implements exactly those endpoints
3. Perfect integration ensured

## Quick Reference

### Frontend Developer v2:
```
Write actual frontend code directly to filesystem.
Do NOT use artifacts. Use write_file for all code.
Update knowledge graph with progress.
Create APIContracts.md for Backend.
```

### Backend Developer v2:
```
Write actual backend code directly to filesystem.
Read Frontend's APIContracts.md first.
Implement exact endpoints specified.
Update knowledge graph with completions.
```

### Continue Session:
```
Read SESSION_STATE.md and HANDOFF.md.
Check knowledge graph for progress.
Continue from documented checkpoint.
Write all new code to filesystem.
```

## File Locations

- Frontend code: `/[project-path]/frontend/src/`
- Backend code: `/[project-path]/backend/src/`
- Session states: In respective directories
- API contracts: `/[project-path]/docs/Frontend Developer/`

Remember: Always write code directly to filesystem, never use artifacts!
